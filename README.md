# rule-engine-with-ast
This project implements an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for evaluating user-defined rules based on given data. The primary focus is on parsing rules in a string format, constructing an AST representation, and evaluating conditions without using eval, ensuring a secure and robust implementation.
